Having one more of a key user for an item is so important to not feel stuck with a certain line.\nI have great expectations for this set and I'm actually excited after watching a few videos. \nI saw animations and stuff happening and not just units auto attacking which is really cool (good job art team all spells look really cool)\nI hope you guys manage to reach set 13 balance wise and thank you for listening to the community!\nCan't wait!",

I really feel like the devs have listened to feedback from previous learnings and as a constant enjoyer of TFT, all the way back from beta I'm so happy the direction you guys are moving. Thanks for being so involved in the community Mortdog and thanks for all the work to bring us our favorite game ever, with an amazing community unlike any other.",
